# Holberg
## A Suite for Musical Composition and Analysis

Holberg itself is an atomic music theory library, built using Pitch Class Set Theory.

There are several built-in basic types:
pitch-class: an integer between 0 and 11 denoting a "note-name"
pc-set: a set of pitch-classes
pitch: a pitch-class, octave pair
collection: a collection of pitches (allows for repetition)
(soon to be added- note: a pitch and duration pair, freq: a frequency)


Holberg currently features two specialized libraries: Seria, for serial 12-tone theory, and Otakar, a library with tools for stringed instruments.
